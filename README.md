# RolodexView #
A simple prototype RolodexView using RecyclerView and CardView.


## TODO ##

- Encapsulate code to an actual view.
- Allow more proper wrapping. (Currently, there are INT_MAX positions and the data shown is `dataset[position % data_size]`)
- Custom scrollbar that shows current location within the dataset.
- Instructions for using.
- More documentation.
- Make sure that this looks the same for pre-L and Lollipop+ devices. (Currently, only tested on Lollipop)
